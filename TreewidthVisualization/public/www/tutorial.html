        <h4> Upload one file:</h4>
        Needs to be .txt, .gr or .dgf format. As well as the nodes need to be numbers. The Pace-Algorithmen canÂ´t generate Code from alphabetics and similiar symbols.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4> Upload two file:</h4>
        One file needs to be from the .gr format and the one needs to be the .td format. This option can be used if you already have used the pace algorithmen on your own computer and is independently from the server function. So this option can used evertyime,
        even if connection problems with the server occured.
