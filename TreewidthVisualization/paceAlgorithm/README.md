## Important if you Clone this Repository
The folder paceAlgorithm is empty.
You need to add a pace algorithm by yourself or use my second repository that 
contains a fork of the PACE2017-TrackA with specific changes for a linux interface
and little changes on head spaces.    
https://github.com/Szadzik/PACE2017-TrackA   or use: git clone https://github.com/Szadzik/PACE2017-TrackA.git     

This changes were for a middle class computer and can also work for you.
Maybe or maybe not, you need to change the head space in the " tw-exact or tw-heuristic file in the PACE2017-TrackA ".

In contrast, if you want to use a different paceAlgorithm, you need to change the algorithm names in the files:
" tw-exact.js and tw-heuristic.js ", in the TreewidthVisualization folder.
